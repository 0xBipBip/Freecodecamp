02 - Declare JavaScript Variables

// JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, 
// symbol, bigint, number, and object.

// Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or 
// start with a number.

// You can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords. 

// var firstName = 'John';
// var age = 30;
// var isEmployed = true;

// let lastName = 'Doe';
// let height = 180;
// let isStudent = false;

// const PI = 3.14;
// const MAX_VALUE = 100;

// Note that var has function scope, while let and const have block scope. Additionally, var v
// ariables can be reassigned and hoisted (moved to the top of their scope), while let and const 
// variables are block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

03 - Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

// you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
// myVariable = 5;
// If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the 
// value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

04 - Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another

// After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator, you can assign the value 
// of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

// var myVar;
// myVar = 5;
// var myNum;
// myNum = myVar;

05 - Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

// It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.
// var myVar = 0;

06 - Declare String Variables

// You can declare a string variable like this:
// var myName = "your name";

// "your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more 
// characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
